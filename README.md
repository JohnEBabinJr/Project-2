# JÖN - For life's everyday emergencies

**JÖN** is a bathroom finder and review app for everyone who needs to find a space to handle life's everyday emergencies. Upon page load there is a popup with instructions for the app's usage.

Enter a location keyword or allow current location to be tracked to get started.

> (Fun fact: due to the "Ö" our app name can be read as 'Jon' or 'Jane')

## Who is our target audience?

Simply put, our target audience is everyone. **JÖN** evolved from our team's initial idea of creating an app for finding gender neutral bathrooms as our society becomes more aware of a demand for them. As we progressed in our development of the app, we realized that adding more search options in the form of filters could address a wider variety of situations that our users could encounter.

Usage examples that we thought of from personal experience and potential users that we spoke to were using the app for:

-Finding the closest **JÖN** in an emergency

-Mapping **JÖNS** for trips or even everyday use for those with chronic conditions or just as a preference

-Finding a baby changing station

-Finding a clean **JÖN**

-Finding gender neutral **JÖNS**

-Finding a **JÖN** that is open late or 24/7 for late night drives

-Finding a wheelchair accessible **JÖN** that isn't too difficult to get to the in the first place

-Checking to see if a **JÖN** is paid or needs an acccess code

-Just finding a place to break from the hustle and bustle of daily life

If the filters that we provided are not sufficient, we have also included a text field to allow the user to leave a personal review of the **JÖN**.

## How was our app built?

The app is hosted by Heroku with using GET and POST routes to add new data. Our front end developer designed the site layout using Bootstrap and Materialize in order to be mobile and desktop friendly. Server-side templating made use of Handlebars.

The new technology that we used was Mapbox which we all researched in order to use it for our project. We used it for displaying map and data inputs.

Our initial database was populated manually by us through the app itself using MySQL. Our intention was that when others use the app, they would assist in collecting a larger amount of data for everyone to use much like services such as Yelp.

Code quality and ease of sharing is maintained via usage of a schema.sql and Travis/ESLint
