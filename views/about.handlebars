    <h2>The Jön Project</h2>


    <p>JÖNS is a bathroom finder and review app for everyone who needs to find a space to handle life's everyday
        emergencies. Upon page load there is a popup with instructions for the app's usage.

        Enter a location keyword or allow current location to be tracked to get started.</p>

    <h4><em>(Fun fact: due to the "Ö" our app name can be read as 'Jon' or 'Jane')
        </em></h4>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <p>Simply put, our target audience is everyone. JÖNS evolved from our team's initial idea of creating an app for
        finding gender neutral bathrooms as our society becomes more aware of a demand for them. As we progressed in
        our
        development of the app, we realized that adding more search options in the form of filters could address a
        wider
        variety of situations that our users could encounter.
    </p>

    <p>The app is hosted by Heroku with [addons] using GET and POST routes to add new data. Our front end developer
        designed the site layout using Bootstrap and Materialize in order to be mobile and desktop friendly.

            Our intial database was populated manually by us through the app itself. Our intention was that when
            others
            use
            the app, they would assist in collecting a larger amount of data for everyone to use much like services
            such
            as
            Yelp.</p>

        Our project requirements were to use \_\_\_
        <br>
        <p>
            The new technology that we used was <strong>Mapbox</strong> which we all researched in order to use it
            for
            our
            project. We used
            it for searching, geocoding, displaying map and pins.
        </p>
        The pages were linked using <strong>Handlebars</strong>
